# Access control

## Types of access controll

- [MAC](#mac) - Mandatory Access Control;
- [RBAC](#rbac) - Role-Based Access Control;
- [DAC](#dac) - Discretionary Access Control;

## MAC

MAC stands for Mandatory Access Control (MAC). its a security model where users are given permissions to resources by an admin or root. These permissions can ONLY be granted by the root user or administrator.Only an administrator can grant permissions or right to objects and resources. In this model only the administrator can change the object user security clearance or security label

## RBAC

RBAC in the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, access to resources is based on the role assigned to a user. In this model, an administrator assigns a user to a role that has certain predetermined right and privileges. Because of the user's association with the role, the user can access certain resources and perform specific tasks. RBAC is also known as Non-Discretionary Access Control. The roles assigned to users are centrally administered.

## DAC

DAC In the Discretionary Access Control (DAC) model, access to resources is based on user's identity. A user is granted permissions to a resource by being placed on an access control list (ACL) associated with resource. An entry on a resource's ACL is known as an Access Control Entry (ACE). When a user (or group) is the owner of an object in the DAC model, the user can grant permission to other users and groups. The DAC model is based on resource ownership.
